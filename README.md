# grpcMiddlewareAuthentication
This is an example implementation of using [go-grpc-middleware](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware) auth package for header based authentication. The emphasize here is to show the usage of AuthFuncOverride so that the auth middleware makes a exeption for the getToken methods.
